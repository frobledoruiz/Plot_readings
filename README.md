PLOTTING RECORDS OF TEMPERATURE AND BLOOD OXYGEN SATURATION

The application has three files:

1- Run file : plot_graph.py

2- Function for select names: name_selextion.py

3- File with lists with columns names: lists.py

The records are stored in a csv file that has columns according to lists in lists.py

Data is plotted depending on when records where taken: i.e. Morning or Evening.
Plot is either morning or evening, but not both. This would be an improvement
